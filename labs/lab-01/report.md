## Free Culture paragraph
This chapter made it clear to me that copyright laws are much more important than they seem to be. The former RPI student that was mentioned in this chapter was simply trying to make a search engine to give himself and those at RPI easier access to information. He did not police what was being put into the search engine, and did not remove anything that others added. He did not charge money for any use of the search engine. The only thing he got out of building this search engine was a more convient way to search for himself and others. Even though he did this simply for convience, he was still hit with a lawsuit of an absurd amount of money from the RIAA. The RIAA sued him for having a search engine full of "pirated" music. He did not add this music to the search engine, however, he had to take reposibility for it when the RIAA got involved becasue he was the one who built the search engine. Throughout my entire life, I don't think I have ever seen someone actually being sued for something similar to this. I know many people who download books and music from "legal" sources, but they never receive any consequences. Seeing the actual consequences for it, it is not pretty or worth it. Open source coding does have its own share of copyrights, and this article just proved how important they are.
