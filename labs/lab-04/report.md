## 3. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
It is important to choose a License so the user knowns what they can and can't do with the source code. The developer may request their copyright be maintained through every usage of their code. Licenses help people see and understand the different restrictions that come with using any project

## 4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?.
It is important because without a license, you don't know what you can or can't do with the source code. The user could do something blantantly against the creator of the codes wishes and not know. It is dangerous to work on a code without a license because, legally, you have no protection. A license gives specific rules for what can and cannot be done, so without it, someone could potentially add one later that makes everything you have been doing with it invalid or illegal.
